# TODO

In increasing order of difficulty:

* Add tests for the plugins we ship with
* Minimize number of attributes on abstract base models and adjust import script accordingly
* Steal/modify all of the [contrib apps from django-contrib-light](https://github.com/yourlabs/django-cities-light/blob/stable/3.x.x/cities_light/contrib) (Django REST Framework integration, chained selects, and autocomplete)
* Integrate [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) to extract Country/City/District/Postal Code from an address string
