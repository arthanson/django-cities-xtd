# Notes

Some datasets are very large (> 100 MB) and take time to download/import.

Data will only be downloaded/imported if it is newer than your data, and only matching rows will be overwritten.

The cities manage command has options, see `--help`.  Verbosity is controlled through the `LOGGING` setting.
