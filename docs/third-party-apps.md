# Third-party Apps / Extensions

These are apps that build on top of the `django-cities`. Useful for essentially extending what `django-cities` can do.

* [django-airports](https://github.com/bashu/django-airports) provides you with airport related model and data (from OpenFlights) that can be used in your Django projects.
